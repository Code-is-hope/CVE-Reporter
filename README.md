# CVE Report Generator

## Overview

This Python script fetches details of Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs) from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) API, processes the data, and generates a detailed HTML report. The report includes summaries of CVEs by severity level and attack vector, and detailed information for each CVE.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (Install using `pip install requests`)
- An API key from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD)

### Obtaining an NVD API Key

1. Visit the [NVD API](https://nvd.nist.gov/developers/request-an-api-key) page.
2. Fill out the form with your information.
3. Once you receive your API key, you'll use it to make requests to the NVD API.

### Setting Up Your NVD API Key

- **Windows:**
  - Open Command Prompt and run:
    ```cmd
    setx NVD_API_KEY "YourAPIKeyHere"
    ```
  - Note: You'll need to restart Command Prompt to use the new environment variable.

- **Linux:**
  - Open your terminal and edit your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` file:
    ```bash
    nano ~/.bashrc  # or use ~/.zshrc if you're using zsh
    ```
  - Add the following line at the end of the file:
    ```bash
    export NVD_API_KEY="YourAPIKeyHere"
    ```
  - Save the file and load the new configuration:
    ```bash
    source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
    ```

## Setup

Clone the repository or download the script to your local machine. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed and the `requests` library added to your environment.

## Preparing the Input File

Before running the script, you need to prepare an `input.txt` file containing the CVE IDs you wish to include in your report. Each CVE ID must be on a new line. Here's an example of how your `input.txt` file should look:

CVE-2021-34527
CVE-2021-44228
CVE-2022-12345

Ensure this file is saved in the same directory as the script for it to be correctly read and processed.

### Steps to Prepare `input.txt`:

1. Create a new text file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the `cve_report_generator.py` script.
2. Add CVE IDs to the file, placing each ID on a separate line.
3. Save the file once all desired CVE IDs are listed.

## Usage

1. Ensure your `input.txt` file is ready and located in the same directory as the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python cve_report_generator.py

The script fetches details for each CVE ID listed in input.txt, generates an output.txt file with the fetched CVE details, and produces a Simtech_cve_report_enhanced.html file with the HTML report.
Report Details

The generated HTML report includes:

A table summarizing the count and average CVSS scores by severity level and attack vector.
Detailed entries for each CVE, including descriptions, CVSS metrics, and references.
Logging
The script uses Python's logging module to log information, warnings, and errors. Check the console output for information about the script's execution and troubleshooting.
